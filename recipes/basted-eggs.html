		<p> 
            This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.
        </p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter </li>
			<li>2 large eggs </li>
			<li>1 tablespoon water  </li>
			<li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
			<li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste </li>
		</ul> 
	

		<ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute. Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>

		</ol>
